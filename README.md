# addtocalendar

I needed to create add to calendar links. The (addtocalendar)[https://addtocalendar.com/] library is great but it wasn't handling the calendar descriptions correctly. So this is a backend that can process some of the add to calendar scenarios.

I connect the `resources/lib/atc.js` file to this backend you need to inject your host in to the js file. Right now this is kinda sloppy, whereing you have to edit the `atc.js` file.
